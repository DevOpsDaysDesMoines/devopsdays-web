"Things are the way they are because they got that way", Gerry Weinberg tells us.  
But what if they weren't that way?  What would need to happen for that to be true?

This talk is for leaders, product owners, scrum masters and developers who know things can be better, but are not sure how to get there.

We'll explore why things got this way and explore real practices which can show improvements immediately.
